This piece can be considered in two distinct ways:

- A meditation on the following lines from Sohrab Sepehri’s poem that carries the same title:

	“if you are coming to me / approach gently, softly, lest you crack / the fragile china of my solitude” 

- A meditation on this “situation”:
	“Musicians have departed to build new lives, leaving their instruments behind. The doctors have done the same, as the teachers, engineers, artists… After drying up all the life-giving flows in this land, what remains to us are the distant echoes of their streams”
