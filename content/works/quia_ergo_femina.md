Quia Ergo Femina draws inspiration from an egg-shaped symbolism of the universe depicted in Scivias, a collection of Hildegard von Bingen's visions. The breathing, ever-changing nature of the cosmic egg is reflected in the piece with a series of transformations, projected by the minute actions of the organist. The piece features its namesake, Hildegard von Bingen's psalm antiphon Quia Ergo Femina, further reflecting the egg metaphor by defining itself as a mere vessel that carries the twelfth-century masterpiece at its core.
