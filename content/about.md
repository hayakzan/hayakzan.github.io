Yiğit Kolat’s music draws inspirations and expressions from a wide array of topics ranging from bytebeats to the application and ethics of artificial intelligence in music. The complicated political and social landscape of his native Turkey is a recurring theme in his diverse output. His works have been recognized by a prestigious array of international organizations, including the Tōru Takemitsu Composition Award, the Queen Elisabeth Competition, Bogliasco Foundation, and the Concours International de Composition Henri Dutilleux. 

Kolat's music has been featured throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia by leading ensembles and soloists, such as the Tokyo Philharmonic, Solistes de L’Orchestre de Tours, Nieuw Ensemble, Talea Ensemble, Argento New Music Project, Athelas Ensemble, Presidential Symphony Orchestra of Turkey, Donatienne Michel-Dansac, Pascal Gallois, Peter Sheppard-Skaerved and Aaron Shorr. His music has been broadcast by the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) and Turkish Radio Television (TRT).

He has presented his research at conferences such as Conference on AI Music Creativity (University of Oxford), Spectralisms International Conference (IRCAM), and Reëmbodied Sound Symposium (Columbia University).
